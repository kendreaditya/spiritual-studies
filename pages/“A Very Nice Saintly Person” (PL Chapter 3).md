	- [[Gour Mohan De]] would invite many sadhus at home, since [[Prabhupada]] was a child. [[ref](((ca7d595d-ff6d-439a-9e86-eb3eda91c85b)))]
	- When [[Prabhupada]] had first met [[Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati]], Sarasvati Thakur was sitting on the rooftop. When Prabhupada had entered, Sarasvati Thakur immediately said “You are educated young men. Why don’t you preach Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s message throughout the whole world?”. This caught Prabhupada by surprise, and Prabhupada submissively questioned Sarasvati Thakur, stating who will hear Lord [[Caitanya Mahaprabhu]] 's message if we are under British rule? Sarasvati Thakur responds, that is a temporary situation, Krishna Consciousness is eternal and no "man-made political system, therefore, can help humanity".

	- [[Bhaktivinoda Thakur]] was not only the a government officer, but also the superintendent of the Jagannath Puri temple. He had 10 children, and still researched and made Krishna Consciousness his main priority. Bhaktivindoa Thakur explains the [[maha mantra]] citing the [[Brhan-naradiya Purana]].[[ref](((63ed3f65-50ec-44c9-af4a-4270a4f1c3c5))), [ref](((63ed3f65-2461-42ec-adbf-d3e36ab7fe5a)))]

He proposed that caste is not what matters, but rather one's actions and qualities.

	- [[Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati]] called the printing press [[brhad-mrdanga]] - a big [[mrdanga]] on the basis that, one could hear the sounds of the mrdanga blocks away, but the brhad-mrdanga (printing press) could be heard across the world (though the books).

	- Although Prabhupada had grown up chanting and learning about the Gita, he wanted to learn about the philosophy in regards to the comments of the vaishnava acharyas. [[ref](((63ed3f65-bc97-4341-ade1-444bcd45ca93)))]

	- In 1911, while his aging father was lying ill, Siddhānta Sarasvatī took up a challenge against pseudo Vaiṣṇavas who claimed that birth in their caste was the prerequisite for preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The caste-conscious *brāhmaṇa* community had become incensed by Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura’s presentation of many scriptural proofs that anyone, regardless of birth, could become a *brāhmaṇa *Vaiṣṇava. These *smārta-brāhmaṇas,* out to prove the inferiority of the Vaiṣṇavas, arranged a discussion. On behalf of his indisposed father, young Siddhānta Sarasvatī wrote an essay, “The Conclusive Difference Between the Brāhmaṇa and the Vaiṣṇava,” and submitted it before his father.

He thought of the printing press as a bṛhad-mṛdaṅga, a big mṛdaṅga. Although the mṛdaṅga drum had traditionally been used to accompany kīrtana, even during the time of Lord Caitanya, and although Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī himself led kīrtana parties and sent groups of devotees chanting in the streets and playing on the mṛdaṅgas, such kīrtanas could be heard only for a block or two.
