## [[Distilled Notes]]
	- [[Bhakti Rakshak Sridhar Maharaj]] explains that in Srila [[Prabhupada]]s bhajan [[krsna taba punya bahe bhai]], [[Prabhupada]] is talking to Krishna actually not the reader/listener. [[Prabhupada]] is saying that his guru, Radharani will be kind to you when you help me in full-filling [[Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati]] Thakur's instruction to spread the message to the west. So [[Krishna]] had no alternative but to help [[Prabhupada]]. ((646e2b42-06a1-4441-b183-c0a53fdbb906))
		- [[Madhukar Prabhu]] also explains that this was also agreed upon by [[Bhumipati Prabhu]] who [[Prabhupada]] told to translate [[Caitanya Bhagavata]]. Hence this is reflected in the [[Gaudiya Gita-Gucca]]

	- Srila A.C. Bhaktivedanta Svami Maharaja said, "My guru is
	  id:: 646e2b42-06a1-4441-b183-c0a53fdbb906
	  Radharani. She will be very gracious to You, Krsna, if You help me in
	  discharging the order of my Gurudeva, if You help me in my
	  propaganda work."
	  
	  krsna taba punya habe bhai, e-punya koribe jabe
	  radharani khusi habe dhruva ati boli toma tai
	  
	  "If You seek anything, if You are in want of anything, Krsna, then that
	  is the good will of Radharani. And She will be pleased with You if
	  You help me, because I am attempting to carry out the order of one
	  whom is none other than Srimati Radharani personified. So You must
	  help me."
	  
	  Krsna had no alternative but to come down to him and help in his
	  propaganda work. He had to come. Svami Maharaja was such a great
	  friend of mine! He went away, but he is still with me through you. He
	  is so kind to me! He is forcibly engaging me. Where else shall we get
	  such a good friend, such a kind friend?
