- Chapter Notes
	- Chapter 1 - Observing the Armies on the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra
		- 1.1 Preparation for War (BG 1-11)
			- Because Dhrtarashtra was blind from birth and also bereft of spiritual vision and he knew
			  that his sons were equally blind in the matter of religion
			- The Kauravas had all the materialistic advantages: Bhism (more experience general than Bhima), but in the end, Krishna still won. In the larger picture, Krishna still wins against all material odds.
		- 1.2 Sign of Victory of Pandavas (BG 12 - 20)
			- Krishna's personal presence confirms victory
			- Goddess of fortune
			- Kurukshetra is a holy place
			- Conchshell of Vishnu
			- Agnidev's chariot
			- Hanumans flag on the chariot
		- 1.3 Krishna Bhakta-vatsala (BG 21 -27)
			- Krishna's the charioteer for Arjuna (which is considered a lower status); therefore he is called Achyuta, as he is infallible and dependable
			- Krishna as Hrsikesa, he directs the mind and sense from the heart of the pure devotee
		- BG. 1.46
			- Such a kind and soft-hearted person, in the devotional service of the Lord, is fit to receive self-knowledge.
		- BG. 1.42
			- Community projects for the four orders of human society, combined with family welfare activities, as they are set forth by the institution of sanātana-dharma, or varṇāśrama-dharma, are designed to enable the human being to attain his ultimate salvation.
		- BG. 1.41
			- Sometimes the forefathers may be suffering from various types of sinful reactions, and sometimes some of them cannot even acquire a gross material body and are forced to remain in subtle bodies as ghosts. Thus, when remnants of prasādam food are offered to forefathers by descendants, the forefathers are released from ghostly or other kinds of miserable life.
			- “Anyone who has taken shelter of the lotus feet of Mukunda, the giver of liberation, giving up all kinds of obligation, and has taken to the path in all seriousness, owes neither duties nor obligations to the demigods, sages, general living entities, family members, humankind or forefathers.” Such obligations are automatically fulfilled by performance of devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
		- BG. 1.37-38
			- Obligation is actually binding when the effect is good, but when the effect is otherwise, then no one can be bound.
	- Chapter 2 - Contents of the Gītā Summarized
		- BG 2.7
			- Arjuna surrenders
		- BG. 2.11
			- You are talking like a learned man, but you do not know that one who is learned – one who knows what is body and what is soul – does not lament for any stage of the body, neither in the living nor in the dead condition.” As explained in later chapters, it will be clear that knowledge means to know matter and spirit and the controller of both
		- BG. 2.13
			- So Bhīṣma and Droṇa, being noble souls, were surely going to have spiritual bodies in the next life, or at least life in heavenly bodies for superior enjoyment of material existence. So, in either case, there was no cause of lamentation.
		- BG. 2.14
			- They arise from sense perception, O scion of Bharata, and one must learn to tolerate them without being disturbed.
		- BG. 2.15
			- Lord Caitanya took sannyāsa at the age of twenty-four, and His dependents, young wife as well as old mother, had no one else to look after them. Yet for a higher cause He took sannyāsa and was steady in the discharge of higher duties. That is the way of achieving liberation from material bondage
		- BG. 2.17
			- “There are innumerable particles of spiritual atoms, which are measured as one ten-thousandth of the upper portion of the hair.”
			- This current of the spirit soul is felt all over the body as consciousness, and that is the proof of the presence of the soul
			- this atomic soul is situated in the heart of every living entity,
		- BG. 2.18
			- The material body is perishable by nature. It may perish immediately, or it may do so after a hundred years. It is a question of time only. There is no chance of maintaining it indefinitely. But the spirit soul is so minute that it cannot even be seen by an enemy, to say nothing of being killed.
			- So from both viewpoints there is no cause of lamentation, because the living entity as he is cannot be killed nor can the material body be saved for any length of time or permanently protected.
		- BG. 2.19
			- The Vedic injunction is mā hiṁsyāt sarvā bhūtāni: never commit violence to anyone. Nor does understanding that the living entity is not killed encourage animal slaughter. Killing the body of anyone without authority is abominable and is punishable by the law of the state as well as by the law of the Lord. Arjuna, however, is being engaged in killing for the principle of religion, and not whimsically.
			- The spirit soul is so small that it is impossible to kill him by any material weapon
		- BG. 2.20
			- The soul is not born, but, because he takes on a material body, the body takes its birth. The soul does not take birth there, and the soul does not die.
			- There are two kinds of sva-dharmas, specific duties. As long as one is not liberated, one has to perform the duties of his particular body in accordance with religious principles in order to achieve liberation. When one is liberated, one’s sva-dharma – specific duty – becomes spiritual and is not in the material bodily concept.
		- BG. 2.21
			- when Kṛṣṇa orders fighting, it must be concluded that violence is for supreme justice, and thus Arjuna should follow the instruction, knowing well that such violence, committed in the act of fighting for Kṛṣṇa, is not violence at all because, at any rate, the man, or rather the soul, cannot be killed; so for the administration of justice, so-called violence is permitted. A surgical operation is not meant to kill the patient, but to cure him. Therefore the fighting to be executed by Arjuna at the instruction of Kṛṣṇa is with full knowledge, so there is no possibility of sinful reaction
		- BG. 2.22
			- Change of body by the atomic individual soul is an accepted fact.
			- One who lays down his life on the sacrificial altar, or in the proper battlefield, is at once cleansed of bodily reactions and promoted to a higher status of life. So there was no cause for Arjuna’s lamentation.
		- BG. 2.23
			- Because they are atomic individual souls eternally (sanātana), they are prone to be covered by the illusory energy, and thus they become separated from the association of the Supreme Lord, just as the sparks of a fire, although one in quality with the fire, are prone to be extinguished when out of the fire
		- BG. 2.24
			- All these qualifications of the atomic soul definitely prove that the individual soul is eternally the atomic particle of the spirit whole, and he remains the same atom eternally, without change.
		- BG. 2.25
			- As described previously, the magnitude of the soul is so small for our material calculation that he cannot be seen even by the most powerful microscope; therefore, he is invisible. As far as the soul’s existence is concerned, no one can establish his existence experimentally beyond the proof of śruti, or Vedic wisdom. We have to accept this truth, because there is no other source of understanding the existence of the soul, although it is a fact by perception. There are many things we have to accept solely on grounds of superior authority.Religious principle is higher than vedic injuction. Arjuna was engaged in killing for the principle of religion and not whimsically
			- Repetition of something is necessary in order that we understand the matter thoroughly, without error.
		- BG. 2.27
			- na tvaṁ śocitum arhasi
			- This cycle of birth and death does not, however, support unnecessary murder, slaughter and war. But at the same time, violence and war are inevitable factors in human society for keeping law and order
		- BG. 2.29
			- Perhaps they have no idea that one must think of the soul, and thus make a solution to the material miseries.
			- But if, somehow or other, one is able to understand the subject matter of the soul, then one’s life is successful.
			- It is very difficult for such inexperienced persons to be situated in the determined action of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. As fools are attached to the flowers of poisonous trees without knowing the results of such attractions, unenlightened men are similarly attracted by such heavenly opulence and the sense enjoyment thereof.
		- BG. 2.30
			- Though the soul is immortal, violence is not encouraged, but at the time of war it is not discouraged when there is actual need for it. That need must be justified in terms of the sanction of the Lord, and not capriciously
		- BG. 2.16
			- Although there is no difference between the energy and the energetic, the energetic is accepted as the Supreme, and the energy or nature is accepted as the subordinate.
		- BG. 2.45
			- The Vedas, like the Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad, as well as the Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad, compare the soul and the Supersoul to two friendly birds sitting on the same tree. One of the birds (the individual atomic soul) is eating the fruit of the tree, and the other bird (Kṛṣṇa) is simply watching His friend. Of these two birds – although they are the same in quality – one is captivated by the fruits of the material tree, while the other is simply witnessing the activities of His friend. Kṛṣṇa is the witnessing bird, and Arjuna is the eating bird. Although they are friends, one is still the master and the other is the servant.
			- Arjuna, as a student and friend of Lord Kṛṣṇa, is advised to raise himself to the transcendental position of Vedānta philosophy where, in the beginning, there is brahma-jijñāsā, or questions on the supreme transcendence
			- When the activities for sense gratification, namely the karma-kāṇḍa chapter, are finished, then the chance for spiritual realization is offered in the form of the Upaniṣads, which are part of different Vedas, as the Bhagavad-gītā is a part of the fifth Veda, namely the Mahābhārata. The Upaniṣads mark the beginning of transcendental life.
		- BG. 2.32
			- Considering all aspects, Arjuna had no reason to refrain from fighting. If he should conquer his enemies, he would enjoy the kingdom; and if he should die in the battle, he would be elevated to the heavenly planets, whose doors were wide open to him. Fighting would be for his benefit in either case.
		- BG. 2.38
			- Lord Kṛṣṇa now directly says that Arjuna should fight for the sake of fighting because He desires the battle
		- BG. 2.39
			- Arjuna has already accepted Kṛṣṇa as his spiritual master by surrendering himself unto Him: śiṣyas te ’haṁ śādhi māṁ tvāṁ prapannam.
			- Consequently, Kṛṣṇa will now tell him about the working process in buddhi-yoga, or karma-yoga, or in other words, the practice of devotional service only for the sense gratification of the Lord.
			- This Sāṅkhya has nothing to do with the Sāṅkhya philosophy of the atheist Kapila. Long before the imposter Kapila’s Sāṅkhya, the Sāṅkhya philosophy was expounded in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam by the true Lord Kapila, the incarnation of Lord Kṛṣṇa, who explained it to His mother, Devahūti. It is clearly explained by Him that the puruṣa, or the Supreme Lord, is active and that He creates by looking over the prakṛti.
			- Thus the buddhi-yoga mentioned in this verse is the devotional service of the Lord, and the word Sāṅkhya mentioned herein has nothing to do with the atheistic sāṅkhya-yoga enunciated by the imposter Kapila. One should not, therefore, misunderstand that the sāṅkhya-yoga mentioned herein has any connection with the atheistic Sāṅkhya. Nor did that philosophy have any influence during that time; nor would Lord Kṛṣṇa care to mention such godless philosophical speculations. Real Sāṅkhya philosophy is described by Lord Kapila in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, but even that Sāṅkhya has nothing to do with the current topics. Here, Sāṅkhya means analytical description of the body and the soul. Lord Kṛṣṇa made an analytical description of the soul just to bring Arjuna to the point of buddhi-yoga, or bhakti-yoga. Therefore, Lord Kṛṣṇa’s Sāṅkhya and Lord Kapila’s Sāṅkhya, as described in the Bhāgavatam, are one and the same. They are all bhakti-yoga. Lord Kṛṣṇa said, therefore, that only the less intelligent class of men make a distinction between sāṅkhya-yoga and bhakti-yoga (sāṅkhya-yogau pṛthag bālāḥ pravadanti na paṇḍitāḥ).
		- BG. 2.40
			- little advancement on this path can protect one from the most dangerous type of fear.
			- Any work begun on the material plane has to be completed, otherwise the whole attempt becomes a failure. But any work begun in Kṛṣṇa consciousness has a permanent effect, even though not finished.
			- One percent done in Kṛṣṇa consciousness bears permanent results, so that the next beginning is from the point of two percent, whereas in material activity without a hundred percent success there is no profit.
		- BG. 2.41
			- When one is engaged in the duties of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he need not act in relationship to the material world with obligations to family traditions, humanity or nationality.
			- The highest perfection of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is renunciation of the material conception of life. This state is automatically achieved by progressive Kṛṣṇa consciousness
			- By satisfaction of the spiritual master, the Supreme Personality of Godhead becomes satisfied. And by not satisfying the spiritual master, there is no chance of being promoted to the plane of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. I should, therefore, meditate and pray for his mercy three times a day, and offer my respectful obeisances unto him, my spiritual master.”
		- BG. 2.42-43
			- Men of small knowledge are very much attached to the flowery words of the Vedas, which recommend various fruitive activities for elevation to heavenly planets, resultant good birth, power, and so forth. Being desirous of sense gratification and opulent life, they say that there is nothing more than this.
		- BG. 2.46
			- When Lord Caitanya was asked by a great Vedic scholar, Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī, why He, the Lord, was chanting the holy name of the Lord like a sentimentalist instead of studying Vedānta philosophy, the Lord replied that His spiritual master had found Him to be a great fool and thus asked Him to chant the holy name of Lord Kṛṣṇa
		- BG. 2.47
			- You have a right to perform your prescribed duty, but you are not entitled to the fruits of action. Never consider yourself the cause of the results of your activities, and never be attached to not doing your duty.
			- One who is attached to the result of his work is also the cause of the action. Thus he is the enjoyer or sufferer of the result of such actions
			- As far as prescribed duties are concerned, they can be fitted into three subdivisions, namely routine work, emergency work and desired activities
			- There are three considerations here: prescribed duties, capricious work, and inaction. Prescribed duties are activities enjoined in terms of one’s acquired modes of material nature. Capricious work means actions without the sanction of authority, and inaction means not performing one’s prescribed duties. The Lord advised that Arjuna not be inactive, but that he perform his prescribed duty without being attached to the result.
		- BG. 2.49
			- Except for work in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, all activities are abominable because they continually bind the worker to the cycle of birth and death. One should therefore never desire to be the cause of work
		- BG. 2.50
			- One’s ignorance can be removed by the instruction of the Bhagavad-gītā, which teaches one to surrender unto Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa in all respects and become liberated from the chained victimization of action and reaction, birth after birth.
		- BG. 2.52
			- here are many good examples in the lives of the great devotees of the Lord of those who became indifferent to the rituals of the Vedas simply by devotional service to the Lord. When a person factually understands Kṛṣṇa and his relationship with Kṛṣṇa, he naturally becomes completely indifferent to the rituals of fruitive activities, even though an experienced brāhmaṇa.
		- BG. 2.53
			- A Kṛṣṇa conscious person, or unflinching devotee of the Lord, should not be disturbed by the flowery language of the Vedas nor be engaged in fruitive activities for promotion to the heavenly kingdom. In Kṛṣṇa consciousness, one comes directly into communion with Kṛṣṇa, and thus all directions from Kṛṣṇa may be understood in that transcendental state. One is sure to achieve results by such activities and attain conclusive knowledge.
		- BG. 2.54
			- Arjuna said: O Kṛṣṇa, what are the symptoms of one whose consciousness is thus merged in transcendence? How does he speak, and what is his language? How does he sit, and how does he walk?
			- Most important is how the man in Kṛṣṇa consciousness speaks; for speech is the most important quality of any man. It is said that a fool is undiscovered as long as he does not speak, and certainly a well-dressed fool cannot be identified unless he speaks, but as soon as he speaks, he reveals himself at once. The immediate symptom of a Kṛṣṇa conscious man is that he speaks only of Kṛṣṇa and of matters relating to Him. Other symptoms then automatically follow, as stated below.
		- BG. 2.55
			- The highly developed soul always remains satisfied in himself by realizing himself as the eternal servitor of the Supreme Lord. Such a transcendentally situated person has no sense desires resulting from petty materialism; rather, he remains always happy in his natural position of eternally serving the Supreme Lord
		- BG. 2.56
			- One who is not disturbed in mind even amidst the threefold miseries or elated when there is happiness, and who is free from attachment, fear and anger, is called a sage of steady mind.
			- Such a fully Kṛṣṇa conscious person is not at all disturbed by the onslaughts of the threefold miseries, for he accepts all miseries as the mercy of the Lord, thinking himself only worthy of more trouble due to his past misdeeds; and he sees that his miseries, by the grace of the Lord, are minimized to the lowest.
			- Similarly, when he is happy he gives credit to the Lord, thinking himself unworthy of the happiness; he realizes that it is due only to the Lord’s grace that he is in such a comfortable condition and able to render better service to the Lord.
			- Attachment means accepting things for one’s own sense gratification, and detachment is the absence of such sensual attachment. But one fixed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness has neither attachment nor detachment because his life is dedicated in the service of the Lord. Consequently he is not at all angry even when his attempts are unsuccessful. Success or no success, a Kṛṣṇa conscious person is always steady in his determination.
		- BG. 2.57
			- In the material world, one who is unaffected by whatever good or evil he may obtain, neither praising it nor despising it, is firmly fixed in perfect knowledge.
			- But one who is fixed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is not affected by good and evil, because he is simply concerned with Kṛṣṇa, who is all-good absolute.
		- BG. 2.2
			- The sthita-dhīr muni is always in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, for he has exhausted all his business of creative speculation.
			- These three divine aspects can be explained by the example of the sun, which also has three different aspects, namely the sunshine, the sun’s surface and the sun planet itself. One who studies the sunshine only is the preliminary student. One who understands the sun’s surface is further advanced. And one who can enter into the sun planet is the highest.
		- BG. 2.58
			- The tortoise can at any moment wind up its senses and exhibit them again at any time for particular purposes. Similarly, the senses of the Kṛṣṇa conscious persons are used only for some particular purpose in the service of the Lord and are withdrawn otherwise. Arjuna is being taught here to use his senses for the service of the Lord, instead of for his own satisfaction. Keeping the senses always in the service of the Lord is the example set by the analogy of the tortoise, who keeps the senses within.
		- BG. 2.59
			- But one who has tasted the beauty of the Supreme Lord Kṛṣṇa, in the course of his advancement in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, no longer has a taste for dead, material things. Therefore, restrictions are there for the less intelligent neophytes in the spiritual advancement of life, but such restrictions are only good until one actually has a taste for Kṛṣṇa consciousness. When one is actually Kṛṣṇa conscious, he automatically loses his taste for pale things.
		- BG. 2.60
			- Therefore, it is very difficult to control the mind and senses without being fully Kṛṣṇa conscious.
		- BG. 2.61
			- One who restrains his senses, keeping them under full control, and fixes his consciousness upon Me, is known as a man of steady intelligence.
		- BG. 2.7
			- On the other hand, the king, although not as powerful a yogī as the sage, but a devotee of the Lord, silently tolerated all the sage’s injustices and thereby emerged victorious.
			- The Vedic wisdom therefore advises that in order to solve the perplexities of life and to understand the science of the solution, one must approach a spiritual master who is in the disciplic succession
			- The kṛpaṇas, or miserly persons, waste their time in being overly affectionate for family, society, country, etc., in the material conception of life.
		- BG. 2.62
			- As illustrated in the above-mentioned verse of Śrī Yāmunācārya, a sincere devotee of the Lord shuns all material sense enjoyment due to his higher taste for spiritual enjoyment in the association of the Lord
		- BG. 2.64
			- Therefore to act or not to act is within his control because he acts only under the direction of Kṛṣṇa.
		- BG. 2.66
			- One who is not connected with the Supreme [in Kṛṣṇa consciousness] can have neither transcendental intelligence nor a steady mind, without which there is no possibility of peace. And how can there be any happiness without peace?
		- BG. 2.68
			- One who has understood this – that only by Kṛṣṇa consciousness is one really established in intelligence and that one should practice this art under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master – is called a sādhaka, or a suitable candidate for liberation.
		- BG. 2.69
			- **What is night for all beings is the time of awakening for the self-controlled; and the time of awakening for all beings is night for the introspective sage.**
		- BG. 2.70
			- That is the proof of a Kṛṣṇa conscious man – one who has lost all inclinations for material sense gratification, although the desires are present.
		- BG. 2.8
			- A scholarly brāhmaṇa, expert in all subjects of Vedic knowledge, is unfit to become a spiritual master without being a Vaiṣṇava, or expert in the science of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. But a person born in a family of a lower caste can become a spiritual master if he is a Vaiṣṇava, or Kṛṣṇa conscious.
		- BG. 2.5
			- According to scriptural codes, a teacher who engages in an abominable action and has lost his sense of discrimination is fit to be abandoned.Hrishksha, you are able to contorl the senses (act) because you are under the direction of Krishna. Otherwise, you will not be able to control the senses because you are not udner the direction of Krishna (artifical contrl).
		- BG. 2.4
			- It is general etiquette that superiors are not to be offered even a verbal fight.yoga
		- BG. 2.3
			- Arjuna was addressed as the son of Pṛthā, who happened to be the sister of Kṛṣṇa’s father Vasudeva.
		- BG. 2.1
			- Compassion for the eternal soul is self-realization.
			- This realization is possible when one works without attachment to fruitive results and is situated in the fixed conception of the real self.
	- Chapter 3 - Karma-yoga
		- [[RENUNCIATION OR WORK]]
			- BG. 3.1
				- Kṛṣṇa consciousness is itself the purifying process, and by the direct method of devotional service it is simultaneously easy and sublime
		- [[NISKAMA-KARMA YOGA]]
			- Sankya Yoga vs Budhi Yoga
			- BG. 3.3
				- Some are inclined to understand it by empirical, philosophical speculation, and others by devotional service.
				- Sāṅkhya-yoga, or the analytical study of the nature of spirit and matter, is the subject matter for persons who are inclined to speculate and understand things by experimental knowledge and philosophy.
				- The Lord has explained, also in the thirty-ninth verse, that by working by the principles of buddhi-yoga, or Kṛṣṇa consciousness, one can be relieved from the bonds of action; and, furthermore, there is no flaw in the process
				- Therefore, both the yogas are interdependent, as religion and philosophy. Religion without philosophy is sentiment, or sometimes fanaticism, while philosophy without religion is mental speculation.
				- he santas, being always in a compact of love with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda (the giver of all pleasures), or Mukunda (the giver of liberation), or Kṛṣṇa (the all-attractive person), cannot accept anything without first offering it to the Supreme Person
			- BG. 3.4
				- Without purification, one cannot attain success by abruptly adopting the fourth order of life (sannyāsa)
				- Without purification of heart, sannyāsa is simply a disturbance to the social order. On the other hand, if someone takes to the transcendental service of the Lord, even without discharging his prescribed duties, whatever he may be able to advance in the cause is accepted by the Lord (buddhi-yoga).
			- BG. 3.5
				- If someone takes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, even though he may not follow the prescribed duties in the śāstras or execute the devotional service properly, and even though he may fall down from the standard, there is no loss or evil for him
			- BG. 3.6
				- five yajñas, known as pañca-mahā-yajña, are necessary
			- BG. 3.8
				- Such activities gradually cleanse the heart of a mundane man and free him from material contamination
			- BG. 3.9
				- Yajña, specifically the saṅkīrtana-yajña prescribed for this age, must therefore be performed to save us at least from scarcity of food supply.
		- FROM KARMA KANDA TO KARMA-YOGA
			- BG. 3.10
				- The Lord created this material world to enable the conditioned souls to learn how to perform yajñas (sacrifices) for the satisfaction of Viṣṇu, so that while in the material world they can live very comfortably without anxiety, and after finishing the present material body they can enter into the kingdom of God. That is the whole program for the conditioned soul. By performance of yajña, the conditioned souls gradually become Kṛṣṇa conscious and become godly in all respects. In the Age of Kali, the saṅkīrtana-yajña (the chanting of the names of God) is recommended by the Vedic scriptures, and this transcendental system was introduced by Lord Caitanya for the deliverance of all men in this age.
			- BG. 3.11
				- Their pleasures and displeasures are dependent on the performance of yajñas by the human being.
				- Lord Viṣṇu is worshiped in all yajñas as the chief beneficiary. It is stated also in the Bhagavad-gītā that Kṛṣṇa Himself is the beneficiary of all kinds of yajñas: bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasām.
				- satisfaction of the yajña-pati is the chief purpose of all yajñas.
			- BG. 3.12
				- The demigods are authorized supplying agents on behalf of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viṣṇu
				- For one who cannot understand what the Personality of Godhead is, sacrifice to the demigods is recommended
				- But ultimately all yajñas are meant for gradual promotion to the transcendental position
				- all of which are supplied by the agents of the Lord, with the purpose that we should make proper use of them to keep ourselves fit and healthy for the purpose of self-realization
				- ord Caitanya, however, inaugurated the easiest performance of yajña, namely the saṅkīrtana-yajña, which can be performed by anyone in the world who accepts the principles of Kṛṣṇa consciousness
			- BG. 3.13
				- Others, who prepare food for personal sense enjoyment, verily eat only sin.
				- Therefore, such devotees always perform yajñas in different modes of devotional service, such as śravaṇam, kīrtanam, smaraṇam, arcanam, etc., and these performances of yajñas keep them always aloof from all kinds of contamination of sinful association in the material world.
				- santas, and they are always in love with the Lord as it is described
				- who are in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, offer food to Kṛṣṇa and then eat – a process which nourishes the body spiritually. By such action not only are past sinful reactions in the body vanquished, but the body becomes immunized to all contamination of material nature
			- BG. 3.14
				- Therefore, a person in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, who eats only food offered to Kṛṣṇa, can counteract all reactions of past material infections,
			- BG. 3.15
				- Yajñārtha-karma, or the necessity of work for the satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa only,
				- Anything performed without the direction of the Vedas is called vikarma
				- But the Vedic directions are so made that one can satisfy one’s perverted desires, then return to Godhead, having finished his so-called enjoyment.
			- BG. 3.16
				- The mammonist philosophy of “work very hard and enjoy sense gratification” is condemned herein by the Lord.
				- self-realization, in either of the three ways – namely karma-yoga, jñāna-yoga or bhakti-yoga.
				- The prosperity of the world depends not on our own efforts but on the background arrangement of the Supreme Lord, directly carried out by the demigods.
		- [[NISKAMA-KARMA TO SET CORRECT EXAMPLE]]
			- BG. 3.17
				- But for one who takes pleasure in the Self, whose human life is one of self-realization, and who is satisfied in the Self only, fully satiated – for him there is no duty.
				- A person who is fully Kṛṣṇa conscious, and is fully satisfied by his acts in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, no longer has any duty to perform.
				- His duty thus becomes self-illuminated by the grace of the Lord, and therefore he no longer has any obligations to the Vedic injunctions
			- BG. 3.27
				- The spirit soul bewildered by the influence of false ego thinks himself the doer of activities that are in actuality carried out by the three modes of material nature.
				- The person in material consciousness is convinced by false ego that he is the doer of everything. He does not know that the mechanism of the body is produced by material nature, which works under the supervision of the Supreme Lord. The materialistic person has no knowledge that ultimately he is under the control of Kṛṣṇa.
				- The ignorant man forgets that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is known as Hṛṣīkeśa, or the master of the senses of the material body, for due to his long misuse of the senses in sense gratification, he is factually bewildered by the false ego, which makes him forget his eternal relationship with Kṛṣṇa.
				- doer - karta
			- BG. 3.30
				- Therefore, O Arjuna, surrendering all your works unto Me, with full knowledge of Me, without desires for profit, with no claims to proprietorship, and free from lethargy, fight
				- The Lord instructs that one has to become fully Kṛṣṇa conscious to discharge duties, as if in military discipline
				- The living entity cannot be happy independent of the cooperation of the Supreme Lord, because the eternal constitutional position of the living entity is to become subordinate to the desires of the Lord.
				- __Nirāśīḥ__ - means that one has to act on the order of the master but should not expect fruitive results. The cashier may count millions of dollars for his employer, but he does not claim a cent for himself
				- __mayi,__ or “unto Me - realizes that nothing in the world belongs to any individual person, but that everything belongs to the Supreme Lord
				-
			- BG. 3.35
				- It is far better to discharge one’s prescribed duties, even though faultily, than another’s duties perfectly. Destruction in the course of performing one’s own duty is better than engaging in another’s duties, for to follow another’s path is dangerous.
				- Question:  Follow exmaple of Lord Chantinya
				- But whether material or spiritual, one should stick to his prescribed duties even up to death, rather than imitate another’s prescribed duties.
				- However, when one transcends the modes of material nature and is fully situated in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he can perform anything and everything under the direction of a bona fide spiritual master.
				- In the transcendental stage, the distinctions of the material world do not apply.
				- PRACTICAL APPLICATION
					- Accepting another’s duty promotes whimsicalityand thus ultimately creates havoc –It creates the option to reject his duty if it proves uncomfortable and thus invites a fall to the platform of accepting and rejecting in terms of sense gratification
					- Accepting another’s duty causes asocial disruption–Prescribed duties are given not only for personal purification but also to have a stable society of different integrated parts. If one decides to change his activities, those who depend on him for certain needs, may be let down
					- Accepting another’s duty is not as easy as one thinks–One’s conditioned tendencies run deeper than he realizes. Giving up one’s natural work is very difficult. Engaging in unnatural work promotes dissatisfaction and thus the risk of falldown to immorality escalates
			- BG. 3.18
				- Nor has he any need to depend on any other living being.
			- BG. 3.19
				- To be a good man or a nonviolent man is a personal attachment, but to act on behalf of the Supreme is to act without attachment for the result. That is perfect action of the highest degree, recommended by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa.
			- BG 3.20
				- King Janaka attained perfection by only performance of prescribed duties
					- Self realized soul but he had to teach his subjects how to perform prescribed duties
				- People should perform work for educating the general masses
					- Krishna and Arjuna
						- Had no need to fight in the Battle of Kurukṣetra, but they fought to teach people in general that violence is also necessary in a situation where good arguments fail. Before the Battle of Kurukṣetra, every effort was made to avoid the war, even by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the other party was determined to fight
				- How experienced persons in Krishna consciousness act
					- Without any interest in the world; still works to teach the public how to live and how to act
				- Experienced persons act in such a way that others will follow
			- BG 3.21
				- Whatever action a great man performs, common men follow. And whatever standards he sets by exemplary acts, all the world pursues.
				- [[ācārya]]- one who teaches properly principles of __śāstra__ (scripture) to teach the common man
				- [[__Manu-saṁhitā__ ]]and similar others, are considered the standard books to be followed by human society
				- king or the executive head of a state, the father and the schoolteacher are all considered to be natural leaders of the innocent people in general
			- BG 3.22
				- Krishna himself does not have any prescribed duties, but he still example in such actives to set an example
				- One who must receive the results of work has some designated duty, but one who has nothing to achieve within the three planetary systems certainly has no duty. And yet Lord Kṛṣṇa is engaged on the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra as the leader of the __kṣatriyas__ because the __kṣatriyas__ are duty-bound to give protection to the distressed. Although He is above all the regulations of the revealed scriptures, He does not do anything that violates the revealed scriptures.
			- BG 3.23
				- Krishna performs prescribes duties so all men would follow His path
				- Some argue that some of Krishna actions are contradictory i.e. actions with the gopis. Krishna often acts like this
			- BG 3.24
				- [[__Varṇa-saṅkara__]] is unwanted population which disturbs the peace of the general society. In order to check this social disturbance, there are prescribed rules and regulations by which the population can automatically become peaceful and organized for spiritual progress in life.
				- [[__īśvaras,__ ]] those who can actually control the movements of the sun and moon, as superior
				- This verse shows ‘varna-sankara’ is caused by ‘not fighting’ and not by ‘fighting’. This refutes Arjuna’s argument based on [[Destruction of family]] as given in Text 1.37 –1.43
			- BG 3.25
				- A person in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and a person not in Kṛṣṇa consciousness are differentiated by different desires
				- He may even act exactly like the ignorant person, who is too much attached to material activities, but one is engaged in such activities for the satisfaction of his sense gratification, whereas the other is engaged for the satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa.
				- [[Question]]: How do we act for the satisfaction of Krishna?
					- Answer: Always over the results to Krishna
			- BG 3.26
				- Therefore a realized soul in Kṛṣṇa consciousness should not disturb others in their activities or understanding, but he should act by showing how the results of all work can be dedicated to the service of Kṛṣṇa.
				- For this fortunate man there is no need to follow the Vedic rituals, because by direct Kṛṣṇa consciousness one can have all the results one would otherwise derive from following one’s [[prescribed duties]].
				- Krishna recommends encouraging  those who are attached to use their work and its fruits for devotional service
				- Levels of work:
					- working only for the fruit [[karma-kanda]]
					- establish Krishna as the goal yet remaining attached to the fruits [[sakama karma yoga]]
					- Completely detached form the fruits of works but still attached to the work instruction [[niskama karma yoga]]
				- Question: If a person in knowledge is expected to set an example, then why don’t they set an example of renunciation?
				- Answer: Most people are not qualified to follow the example of renunciation. If an attached person renounces worldly responsibilities, he will eventually try to fulfill desires through irresponsible means
			- BG 3.28
				- The knower of the Absolute Truth is convinced of his awkward position in material association. He knows that he is part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, and that his position should not be in the material creation.
				- He therefore engages himself in the activities of Kṛṣṇa consciousness and becomes naturally unattached to the activities of the material senses, which are all circumstantial and temporary.
				- He knows that his material condition of life is under the supreme control of the Lord; consequently he is not disturbed by all kinds of material reactions, which he considers to be the mercy of the Lord
				- According to __[Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam](https://vedabase.io/en/library/sb/),__ one who knows the Absolute Truth in three different features – namely Brahman, Paramātmā and the Supreme Personality of Godhead – is called __tattva-vit,__ for he knows also his own factual position in relationship with the Supreme.
				- Silra Vishvanath Cakravrti Thakura states, "I am not a guna, nor any product of a guna, nor do i have any connection with any of the gunas or the products of the gunas" AC writes "convieced of this akward postion materail association"
				- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fkendreaditya%2F8kMX4HnXEb.png?alt=media&token=a05e023a-fc35-45da-9200-f9e4a6b58021)
			- BG 3.29
				- Bewildered by the modes of material nature, the ignorant fully engage themselves in material activities and become attached. But the wise should not unsettle them, although these duties are inferior due to the performers’ lack of knowledge.
				- __manda __- a lazy person without understanding of spirit soul
				- Those who are enlightened in spiritual life, however, should not try to agitate such materially engrossed persons. Better to prosecute one’s own spiritual activities silently.
				- Men who are ignorant cannot appreciate activities in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and therefore Lord Kṛṣṇa advises us not to disturb them and simply waste valuable time. But the devotees of the Lord are more kind than the Lord because they understand the purpose of the Lord.
				- Practical Application
					- One who realizes the futility of materialistic activities should not encourage the masses to give up work prematurely
					- Instead he should encourage them to work by his own example
					- Engaging in the prescribed process of purification slowly but surely brings one to genuine self-realisation, but premature renunciation simply makes one a social parasite
				- Question: What is the end of all Vedic rituals?
				- Answer: Vedic rituals are meant for understanding Krishna, the ultimate goal of life
			- BG 3.31
				- The injunction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, is the essence of all Vedic wisdom and therefore is eternally true without exception. As the __Vedas__ are eternal, so this truth of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is also eternal.
				- In the beginning of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, one may not fully discharge the injunctions of the Lord, but because one is not resentful of this principle and works sincerely without consideration of defeat and hopelessness, he will surely be promoted to the stage of pure Kṛṣṇa consciousness.
			- BG 3.32
				- As there is punishment for disobedience to the order of the supreme executive head, so there is certainly punishment for disobedience to the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
			- BG 3.33
				- Unless one is situated on the transcendental platform of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he cannot get free from the influence of the modes of material nature, as it is confirmed by the Lord in the Seventh Chapter (7.14).
				- Kṛṣṇa consciousness helps one to get out of the material entanglement, even though one may be engaged in his prescribed duties in terms of material existence. Therefore, without being fully in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, one should not give up his occupational duties.
				- No one should suddenly give up his prescribed duties and become a so-called __yogī__ or transcendentalist artificially. It is better to be situated in one’s position and to try to attain Kṛṣṇa consciousness under superior training. Thus one may be freed from the clutches of Kṛṣṇa’s __māyā.__
			- BG 3.34
				- There are principles to regulate attachment and aversion pertaining to the senses and their objects. One should not come under the control of such attachment and aversion, because they are stumbling blocks on the path of self-realization.
				- Therefore, no one should try to be detached from Kṛṣṇa consciousness at any stage of life. The whole purpose of detachment from all kinds of sense attachment is ultimately to become situated on the platform of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.
				- Attachment and aversion pertaining to senses and their objects. Do not come under the control of such attachment and aversion
				- There is always a chance of accident, even on royal road
					- As long as the material body is there, the necessities of material body are allowed, but under rules and regulations
			- BG 3.35
		- [[Conquering the Ultimate Enemy: Lust]]
			- Summarised
				- Born of mode of passion (3.37)
				- Changes into wrath (born of the mode of ignorance) (3.37)
				- Forces us to act sinfully (3.37)
				- All devouring greatest enemy of living entity (3.37)
				- Covers the living entity’s pure consciousness (3.38)
					- As smoke covers fire
					- Mirror covered by dust
					- Embryo covered by womb
				- Lust is never satisfied, like fire (3.39)
				- Sitting places of lust
				- Senses, Mind and Intelligence (3.40)
				- jnana (knowledge) and vijana (self realisation) (3.41)
			- BG 3.36
				- A living entity, as part and parcel of the Supreme, is originally spiritual, pure, and free from all material contaminations. Therefore, by nature he is not subject to the sins of the material world.
				- Sinful actions are not, however, impelled by the Supersoul within, but are due to another cause, as the Lord explains in the next verse.
				- I will act only according to sastra.” Experience teaches,  however,  that  such immediate  inspirations  may  prove  difficult  to  adhere  to  over  time.  Arjuna,  being  aware  of  reality,  asks  the following question.
			- BG 3.37
				- **The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: It is lust only, Arjuna, which is born of contact with the material mode of passion and later transformed into wrath, and which is the all-devouring sinful enemy of this world.**
				- If, therefore, the mode of passion, instead of being degraded into the mode of ignorance, is elevated to the mode of goodness by the prescribed method of living and acting, then one can be saved from the degradation of wrath by spiritual attachment.
				- They also have partial independence, but by misuse of their independence, when the service attitude is transformed into the propensity for sense enjoyment, they come under the sway of lust.
				- This material creation is created by the Lord to give facility to the conditioned souls to fulfill these lustful propensities, and when completely baffled by prolonged lustful activities, the living entities begin to inquire about their real position.
				- This inquiry is the beginning of the __Vedānta-sūtras,__ wherein it is said, __athāto brahma-jijñāsā:__ one should inquire into the Supreme. And the Supreme is defined in __[Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam](https://vedabase.io/en/library/sb/)__ as __janmādy asya yato ’nvayād itarataś ca,__ or, “The origin of everything is the Supreme Brahman.” Therefore the origin of lust is also in the Supreme. If, therefore, lust is transformed into love for the Supreme, or transformed into Kṛṣṇa consciousness – or, in other words, desiring everything for Kṛṣṇa – then both lust and wrath can be spiritualized.
				- **Characterizes of Lust:**
					- Bron of mode of passion
					- changes into wrath
					- forces us to act singully
					- all devouring geretest enmy of living enity
				- Then one can be saved from the degradation of wrath, by spiritual attachment
			- BG 3.38
				- 3 degrees - lust under different covering
					- a fire covered by somke
					- dust on the mirror
					- embryo covered by the womb
				- Although fire is necessary where there is smoke, there is no overt manifestation of fire in the early stage. This stage is like the beginning of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.
			- BG 3.39
				- In a completely different analogy, Krishna compares lust to fire.
				- Lust is never satisfied with any amount of fuel: it simply grows as it is fed
				- The best way to stop lustis to stop feeding it and let it die
			- BG 3.40
				- The enemy has captured different strategic positions in the body of the conditioned soul, and therefore Lord Kṛṣṇa is giving hints of those places, so that one who wants to conquer the enemy may know where he can be found.
				- Mind is the center of all the activities of the senses, and thus when we hear about sense objects the mind generally becomes a reservoir of all ideas of sense gratification
				- Sitting Places of lust
				  Sense
				  Mind
				  Intelligence
					- The mind and the senses become the repositories of lust. Next, the intelligence department becomes the capital of such lustful propensities.
					- Intelligence is next to the spirit soul.
					- Lusty intelligence influences the spirit soul to acquire the false ego and identify itself with matter
					- The spirit soul becomes addicted to enjoying the material senses and mistakes this as true happiness.
			- BG 3.41
				- __Jñāna__ refers to knowledge of self as distinguished from non-self, or in other words, knowledge that the spirit soul is not the body.
				- __Vijñāna__ refers to specific knowledge of the spirit soul’s constitutional position and his relationship to the Supreme Soul.
				- The living entities are parts and parcels of the Lord, and therefore they are simply meant to serve the Lord.
				- Lust is only the perverted reflection of the love of God which is natural for every living entity.
				- One’s senses are influenced by lust when he feels attracted to pleasure and repulsed by pain
			- BG 3.42
				- **hierarchy of bodily functions**
					- senses
					- object sense gratification
					- mind
					- determination of the intelligence
					- soul
				- With intelligence one has to seek out the constitutional position of the soul and then engage the mind always in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.
				- **Only stoppage of bodily action does not help**
					- Bodily action means function of the senses and stopping the senses means stopping all bodily action
					- But the mind is always active, even though the body may be silent
					- Therefore the soul has to be directly engaged with the Supreme, then all other subordinates
			- BG 3.43
	- Chapter 4 - Transcendental Knowledge
		- Transcendental Knowledge About Krishna
			- BG 4.1
				- Order of succession
					- Krishna
					- Vivasvan
					- Manu
					- Iksvaku
				- the executive heads of all states are intended to spread the science of Kṛṣṇa consciousness
				- Vivasvān, the king of the sun, which is the origin of all planets within the solar system
			- BG 4.2
				- Gita meant for saintly kings, because they were to excute its purpose
				- Not meant for demonic persons
			- BG 4.3
				- Krishan told Arjuna because he is his friend and devotee
				- two calsses of men: devotee and the deomon.
				- rahasya - one's relationship with krishna is secret, confidential, and mysterious
			- BG 4.4
				- Arjuna said: The sun-god Vivasvān is senior by birth to You. How am I to understand that in the beginning You instructed this science to him?
				- The fact is that Arjuna is not inquiring for himself but for those who do not believe in the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
			- BG 4.5
				- In the __Vedas__ also it is said that the Lord, although one without a second, manifests Himself in innumerable forms. He is like the __vaidūrya__ stone, which changes color yet still remains one. All those multiforms are understood by the pure, unalloyed devotees, but not by a simple study of the __Vedas__ (__vedeṣu durlabham adurlabham ātma-bhaktau__).
				- Devotees like Arjuna are constant companions of the Lord, and whenever the Lord incarnates, the associate devotees also incarnate in order to serve the Lord in different capacities. Arjuna is one of these devotees, and in this verse it is understood that some millions of years ago when Lord Kṛṣṇa spoke the __[Bhagavad-gītā](https://vedabase.io/en/library/bg/)__ to the sun-god Vivasvān, Arjuna, in a different capacity, was also present. But the difference between the Lord and Arjuna is that the Lord remembered the incident whereas Arjuna could not remember.
				- __acyuta__ - infallible, which means that He never forgets Himself, even though He is in material contact
			- BG 4.6
				- __Prakṛti__ means “nature,” as well as __svarūpa,__ or “one’s own form.”
				- The Vedic supplementary literatures also confirm that even though the Lord appears to be taking His birth, He is still without change of body.
				- __māyā,__ or __ātma-māyā,__ refers to the Lord’s causeless mercy
			- BG 4.7
				- __sṛjāmi__ means that the Lord manifests Himself as He is
				- Principles of religion are laid down in the __Vedas,__ and any discrepancy in the matter of properly executing the rules of the __Vedas__ makes one irreligious.
				- The __Vedas__ are also accepted as originally spoken by the Lord Himself to Brahmā, from within his heart.
				- In each and every incarnation, **He speaks as much about religion as can be understood by the particular people under their particular circumstances**. But the mission is the same – to lead people to God consciousness and obedience to the principles of religion.
			- BG 4.8
				- __sādhu__ - (holy man) is a man in Kṛṣṇa consciousness
				- __duṣkṛtām__ - applies to those who do not care for Kṛṣṇa consciousness (foolish and the lowest of mankind)
				- Therefore it is said here that to deliver the devotee and vanquish the demon miscreants, the Lord appears in different incarnations.
				- Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa descends for the specific purpose of mitigating the anxieties of the pure devotees, who are very anxious to see Him in His original Vṛndāvana pastimes. Therefore, the prime purpose of the Kṛṣṇa __avatāra__ is to satisfy His unalloyed devotees.
				- __avatāras,__ such as __puruṣāvatāras, guṇāvatāras, līlāvatāras, śakty-āveśa avatāras, manvantara-avatāras__ and __yugāvatāras__
			- BG 4.9
				- One who can understand the truth of the appearance of the Personality of Godhead is already liberated from material bondage
				- a faithful devotee of the Lord attains perfection
				- Question: How do we understand the transcentral nature of Lord's birth and activates?
				- Answer: Being freed from attachment, fear and anger, being fully absorbed in Me and taking refuge in Me, many, many persons in the past became purified by knowledge of Me – and thus they all attained transcendental love for Me. (4.10)
			- BG 4.10
				- One has to get rid of all three stages of material consciousness: attachment to material life, fear of a spiritual personal identity, and the conception of void that arises from frustration in life.
				- **Degrees of affliction**
					- **Raga - strong attachment to material life**
					- **Bhaya - fear of personal spritual identiy**
					- **Krodha - Conception of void resulting from frustration of life**
		- Applying Transcendental Knowledge
			- BG 4.11
				- Everyone is searching for Kṛṣṇa in the different aspects of His manifestations
				- Kṛṣṇa rewards all the devotees equally, according to their different intensities of love for Him.
			- BG 4.12
				- Actually, the demigods are not different forms of God, but they are God’s different parts and parcels. God is one, and the parts and parcels are many. The __Vedas__ say, __nityo nityānām:__ God is one. __Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ.__
				- Anyone who thinks that God and the demigods are on the same level is called an atheist, or __pāṣaṇḍī__
				- foolish people (__hṛta-jñāna__) worship the demigods because they want immediate results
			- BG 4.13
				- And as Kṛṣṇa is transcendental to this system of the four divisions of human society, a person in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is also transcendental to all divisions of human society, whether we consider the divisions of community, nation or species.
				- **Doers**
					- Jiva - wishes
					- Kirshna - admonitions/sanctions
					- Material Nature - facilitates
			- BG 4.14
				- the Lord, although He is the creator of this material world, is not affected by the activities of the material world
				- The proprietor of an establishment is not responsible for the right and wrong activities of the workers, but the workers are themselves responsible. The living entities are engaged in their respective activities of **sense gratification, and these activities are not ordained by the Lord**
				- **The Lord only gives him facilities, through the agency of material nature, the external energy.**
				- **the Lord is never partial to any living entity**
				- the Lords activates are internal energy and don't fall within in the Varnasrama system
				- Krishna is not responsible for our position in Varnasrama and for right and wrong activities
			- BG 4.15
				- There are two classes of men. Some of them are full of polluted material things within their hearts, and some of them are materially free. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is equally beneficial for both of these persons.
				- **when the jiva understands these facts about Krishna and applies this transcendental knowledge to his own work and becomes a servant of Krishna, he also becomes aloof from the material whirl of action and reaction.**
		- Understating Karma on the Platform of Jnana
			- Acting in pure devotional service is akarma, free from reactions. This is because karmic reaction is a result of fruitive consciousness and not activity itself
			- BG. 4.16
				- **action is, knowing which you shall be liberated from all misfortune**
				- It is said that one cannot ascertain the ways of religion simply by imperfect experimental knowledge.
				- To understand Kṛṣṇa consciousness and action according to its modes, one has to learn one’s relationship with the Supreme; i.e., one who has learned perfectly knows that every living entity is an eternal servitor of the Lord and that consequently one has to act in Kṛṣṇa consciousness
			- BG. 4.17
				- To understand Kṛṣṇa consciousness and action according to its modes, one has to learn one’s relationship with the Supreme; i.e., one who has learned perfectly knows that every living entity is an eternal servitor of the Lord and that consequently one has to act in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The entire Bhagavad-gītā is directed toward this conclusion. Any other conclusions against this consciousness and its attendant actions are **vikarmas** or prohibited actions
			- BG 4.18
				- A person acting in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is naturally free from the bonds of **karma**
				- **Akarma **means without reaction to work. The impersonalist ceases fruitive activities out of fear, so that the resultant action may not be a stumbling block on the path of self-realization, but the personalist knows rightly his position as the eternal servitor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore he engages himself in the activities of Kṛṣṇa consciousness
			- BG 4.19
				- Freedom from reaction can result from proper action and sinful reaction can result from improper renunciation
			- BG 4.20
				- A Kṛṣṇa conscious person acts out of pure love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore he has no attraction for the results of the action
				- We should not give up work; we should be satisfied by dutiful work. We should also give up attachment to the fruits of the work. Such a person actually does “nothing.” This verse describes a **sadhaka**, one trying for perfection.
				- perfected **siddha**
			- BG 4.21
				- ^^A Kṛṣṇa conscious person does not expect good or bad results in his activities^^
				- **siddha** greedy for Krsna’s service
			- BG 4.22
				- He neither begs nor borrows, **but he labors honestly as far as is in his power and is satisfied with whatever is obtained by his own honest labor.**
					- Sripada Madhavendra Puri is an example of a devotee on this level. Madhavendra Puri neither worked nor begged for his food. He ate only when someone was prompted by Krsna from within to offer him food
			- BG 4.23
				- whatever he does, he does for Kṛṣṇa, who is the primeval Viṣṇu
				- bhakti-lata, the creeper of devotional service
				- Cultivating Krsna conscious knowledge is therefore essential. Only then can knowledge and work be combined so that one’s work becomes a sacrifice to Krsna.
			- BG 4.24
				- the Lord is spiritual, and the rays of His transcendental body are called **brahma-jyotir** His spiritual effulgence
				- The Absolute Truth covered by __māyā__ is called matter
				- Question: Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the process of converting the illusory consciousness into Brahman, or the Supreme. When the mind is fully absorbed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, it is said to be in samādhi, or trance. Anything done in such transcendental consciousness is called yajña, or sacrifice for the Absolute. In that condition of spiritual consciousness, the contributor, the contribution, the consumption, the performer or leader of the performance and the result or ultimate gain – everything – becomes one in the Absolute, the Supreme Brahman. That is the method of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.
				- **Acting in a devotional mood with freedom from the desires of sense gratification uncovers the spiritual nature. In this way, acts of sacrifice connect one with transcendence.**
		- Sacrifices lead to Transcendental Knowledge
			- BG 4.25
				- **Factually sacrifice means to satisfy the Supreme Lord, Viṣṇu, who is also known as Yajña.**
				- In other words, the fruitive workers sacrifice their material possessions for material enjoyment, whereas the impersonalist sacrifices his material designations with a view to merging into the existence of the Supreme. For the impersonalist, the fire altar of sacrifice is the Supreme Brahman, and the offering is the self being consumed by the fire of Brahman.
				- The Kṛṣṇa conscious person, like Arjuna, however, sacrifices everything for the satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa, and thus all his material possessions as well as his own self – everything – is sacrificed for Kṛṣṇa. Thus, he is the first-class __yogī;__ but he does not lose his individual existence.
			- BG 4.26
				- The members of the four divisions of human life, namely the __brahmacārī,__ the __gṛhastha,__ the __vānaprastha__ and the __sannyāsī,__ are all meant to become perfect __yogīs__ or transcendentalists. Since human life is not meant for our enjoying sense gratification like the animals, the four orders of human life are so arranged that one may become perfect in spiritual life.
			- BG 4.27
				- The __yoga__ system conceived by Patañjali is referred to herein. In the __Yoga-sūtra__ of Patañjali, the soul is called __pratyag-ātmā__ and __parāg-ātmā.__ As long as the soul is attached to sense enjoyment it is called __parāg-ātmā,__ but as soon as the same soul becomes detached from such sense enjoyment it is called __pratyag-ātmā.__
			- BG 4.28
				- Kṛṣṇa consciousness cannot be attained by any one of the above-mentioned types of sacrifice but can be attained only by the mercy of the Lord and His bona fide devotees.
			- BG 4.29
				- A Kṛṣṇa conscious person, however, being always situated in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, automatically becomes the controller of the senses. His senses, being always engaged in the service of Kṛṣṇa, have no chance of becoming otherwise engaged.
				- **Reducing the eating process** is very helpful in the matter of sense control. And without sense control there is no possibility of getting out of the material entanglement.
			- BG 4.30
				- All the above-mentioned sacrifices help one to become cleansed of the sinful reactions of material existence. By this advancement in life, not only does one become happy and opulent in this life, but also, at the end, he enters into the eternal kingdom of God, either merging into the impersonal Brahman or associating with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa.
			- BG 4.31
				- But the highest kind of happiness that a man can achieve is to be promoted to the spiritual planets by practice of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. A life of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is therefore the solution to all the problems of material existence.
			- BG 4.32
				- But all of them are recommended for ultimately bringing about liberation from the body. This is confirmed by the Lord herewith from His own mouth.
			- BG 4.33
				- Real knowledge culminates in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the highest stage of transcendental knowledge. **Without the elevation of knowledge, sacrifices are simply material activities.**
		- Conclusion
			- BG 4.34
				- **Just try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master. Inquire from him submissively and render service unto him. The self-realized souls can impart knowledge unto you because they have seen the truth.**
				- Therefore, mental speculation or dry arguments cannot help lead one to the right path
			- BG 4.35
				- One learns that all living entities are parts and parcels of the Supreme Personality of Godhead
			- BG 4.36
				- Even if you are considered to be the most sinful of all sinners, when you are situated in the boat of transcendental knowledge you will be able to cross over the ocean of miseries.
			- BG 4.37
				- As a blazing fire turns firewood to ashes, O Arjuna, so does the fire of knowledge burn to ashes all reactions to material activities.
			- BG 4.38
				- In this world, there is nothing so sublime and pure as transcendental knowledge. Such knowledge is the mature fruit of all mysticism. And one who has become accomplished in the practice of devotional service enjoys this knowledge within himself in due course of time.
			- BG 4.39
				- **A person who is faithful to Kṛṣṇa and who controls the senses can easily attain perfection in the knowledge of Kṛṣṇa consciousness without delay**
			- BG 4.40
				- One who acts in devotional service, renouncing the fruits of his actions, and whose doubts have been destroyed by transcendental knowledge, is situated factually in the self. Thus he is not bound by the reactions of work, O conqueror of riches.

	- Chapter 5 - Karma-yoga – Action in Kṛṣṇa Consciousness
		- ADD 1st section
		- HOW TO PERFORM NISKAMA-KARMA-YOGA
			- BG 5.7
				- Because one who works in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is servant to all, he is very dear to everyone. And because everyone is satisfied by his work, he is pure in consciousness. Because he is pure in consciousness, his mind is completely controlled. And because his mind is controlled, his senses are also controlled. Because his mind is always fixed on Kṛṣṇa, there is no chance of his being deviated from Kṛṣṇa. Nor is there a chance that he will engage his senses in matters other than the service of the Lord. He does not like to hear anything except topics relating to Kṛṣṇa; he does not like to eat anything which is not offered to Kṛṣṇa; and he does not wish to go anywhere if Kṛṣṇa is not involved. **Therefore, his senses are controlled.**
				- **Therefore, his senses are controlled. A man of controlled senses cannot be offensive to anyone. One may ask, “Why then was Arjuna offensive (in battle) to others? Wasn’t he in Kṛṣṇa consciousness?” Arjuna was only superficially offensive because (as has already been explained in the Second Chapter) all the assembled persons on the battlefield would continue to live individually, as the soul cannot be slain.**
			- BG 5.8-5.9
				- **Always knows within himself that he actually does nothing at all. Because he always knows that only the material senses are engaged with their objects and that he is aloof from them.**
				- In material consciousness, the senses are engaged in sense gratification, but in Kṛṣṇa consciousness the senses are engaged in the satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa’s senses.
			- BG 5.10
				- One who performs his duty without attachment, surrendering the results unto the Supreme Lord, is unaffected by sinful action, as the lotus leaf is untouched by water.
				- **To see everything in relation to Krishna**
				- The conclusion is that a person without Kṛṣṇa consciousness acts according to the concept of the material body and senses, but a person in Kṛṣṇa consciousness acts according to the knowledge that the body is the property of Kṛṣṇa and should therefore be engaged in the service of Kṛṣṇa.
			- BG 5.11
				- A person acting in Kṛṣṇa consciousness (or, in other words, in the service of Kṛṣṇa) with his body, mind, intelligence and words is a liberated person even within the material world, although he may be engaged in many so-called material activities [Śrī Rūpa Gosvāmī in his __Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu__ (1.2.187)]
				- When he applies everything** produced of the body, mind, intelligence, words, life, wealth, etc. – whatever he may have within his possession – to Kṛṣṇa’s service**, he is at once dovetailed with Kṛṣṇa. He is one with Kṛṣṇa and is devoid of the false ego that leads one to believe that he is the body, etc. This is the perfect stage of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.
				- ^^Vishaka has a funny story^^
					- Krishna owns everything
			- BG 5.12
				- 1. In kwnolde -> understanding? -> love CC
				- 2. WHy do we do work
				- The person who is attached to Kṛṣṇa and works for Him only is certainly a liberated person, and he has no anxiety over the results of his work. In the [__Bhāgavatam__](https://vedabase.io/en/library/sb/)__,__ the cause of anxiety over the result of an activity is explained as being one’s functioning in the conception of duality, that is, without knowledge of the Absolute Truth
				- **Stress Free Life**
				- **But one who is entangled in profit calculation for sense gratification cannot have that peace. This is the secret of Kṛṣṇa consciousness** – realization that there is no existence besides Kṛṣṇa is the platform of peace and fearlessness.
		- PLATFORM OF KNOWLEDGE – KNOWING THE THREE DOERS
			- BG 5.13
				- **When the embodied living being controls his nature and mentally renounces all actions, he resides happily in the city of nine gates [the material body], neither working nor causing work to be done.**
				- nine gates -> material body
					- two eyes, two nostrils, two ears, one mouth, the anus and the genitals (Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad 3.18)
					- Embodied living entity resides happily in the city of nine gates, neither working nor causing work to be done, when he controls his nature and mentally renounces all actions
				- The living entity in his conditioned stage identifies himself with the body, but when he identifies himself with the Lord within himself, he becomes just as free as the Lord, even while in the body
					- ^^HOW?^^
			- BG 5.14
				- As long as he is in the city of the body, he appears to be the master of it, but actually, **he is neither its proprietor nor controller of its actions and reactions. All happen by the mode of material nature. The modes of material nature are controlled by the Supersoul. **His best solution is to get out of the water by transcendental Kṛṣṇa consciousness. **That alone will save him from all turmoil.**
			- BG 5.15
				- **Nor does the Supreme Lord assume anyone’s sinful or pious activities. Embodied beings, however, are bewildered because of the ignorance which covers their real knowledge.**
				- **__vibhu __** means the Supreme Lord who is full of unlimited knowledge, riches, strength, fame, beauty and renunciation
				- when the living entity is bewildered in his desires, the Lord allows him to fulfill those desires, but the Lord is never responsible for the actions and reactions of the particular situation which may be desired
				- ^^Man proposes and God disposes^^
					- Man wants god provides
				- __Vaiṣamya-nairghṛṇye na sāpekṣatvāt tathā hi darśayati: __“The Lord neither hates nor likes anyone, though He appears to.”
				- **How the living entity in the tight grip of material nature is the doer can be compared to the attempt of a small boy to lift a weight he has just seen his father lift. The boy first desires to lift the weight and then tries. He cannot possibly succeed, but his father sees his small son’s desire, stands above him, and out of affection does the actual lifting. Thus the father has actually lifted the weight, but he cannot be considered the only lifter. Unless the desire had been expressed and the attempt made by the child, the father never would have helped, and the weight would not have been lifted.**

		- LIBERATION BY FOCUSSING ON THE SUPERSOUL
			- BG 5.17
				- By fixing one’s mind, intelligence, faith and refuge in Krishna one is washed of all misgivings
				- One achieves perfect knowledge in everything concerning transcendence – Thus achieves thorough understanding that there is duality in Krishna (Simultaneous identity and individuality)
			- **BG 5.18**
				- A Kṛṣṇa conscious person does not make any distinction between species or castes. The __brāhmaṇa__ and the outcaste may be different from the social point of view, or a dog, a cow and an elephant may be different from the point of view of species, but these **differences of body are meaningless from the viewpoint of a learned transcendentalist.**
				- A Kṛṣṇa conscious person has full knowledge of this, and therefore he is truly learned and has equal vision. The similar characteristics of the soul and Supersoul are that they are both conscious, eternal and blissful. But the difference is that the individual soul is conscious within the limited jurisdiction of the body whereas the Supersoul is conscious of all bodies. The Supersoul is present in all bodies without distinction.
				- Equal Vision
					- Lord treats everyone as a friend
						- body are meaningless from the viewpoint of a learned transcendentalis
			- **BG 5.19**
				- Equanimity of mind, as mentioned above, is the sign of self-realization
				- **The Lord is flawless because He is without attraction or hatred. Similarly, when a living entity is without attraction or hatred, he also becomes flawless and eligible to enter into the spiritual sky**. Such persons are to be considered already liberated, and their symptoms are described below.
				- __Brahmawadi__ - sees everything situated in Brahman
				- __Paramatmavadi__ - sees Supersoul at work
					- Understands that everything is happening at the Lord’s will
				- __Devotee of Krishna__ - recognizes that everything happens as Krishna’s kindness and increase his devotion
			- **BG 5.20**
				- symptoms of the self-realized
					- not illusioned by the false identification of the body with his true self
					- not joyful in achieving something, nor does he lament in losing anything which is related to his body
						- __sthira-buddhi,__ or self-intelligence
					- never bewildered by mistaking the gross body for the soul
					- not accept the body as permanent and disregard the existence of the soul
			- BG 5.21
				- The highest taste in material world sex, however person engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness can work with greater vigor without sex pleasure, which he avoids
				- Spiritual realization and sex pleasure go ill together
			- BG 5.22
				- Upmost desires is from Krishna
			- BG 5.23
				- __gosvāmī,__ or __svāmī__ are one who can control the forces of all these different senses and strictly controlled lives and forgo altogether the forces of the senses
					- forces of talk
					- forces of anger
					- forces of mind
					- forces of the stomach
					- forces of the genitals
					- forces of the tongue
			- BG 5.24
				- __brahma-bhūta__ is a person who can sit silently at any place and enjoy the activities of life from within
				- We must get a higher taste. It is urgent. We have to hear, chant and have good association; otherwise, we will be unable to tolerate the urges of the senses over time.
			- BG 5.25
				- **Only a person who is fully in Kṛṣṇa consciousness can be said to be engaged in welfare work for all living entities.**
				- Brahma-nirvana stage is a person that is liberated
				- **one’s difficulties is “forgetfulness of one’s relationship with the Supreme Lord”**
			- BG 5.26
				- A devotee of the Lord, constantly engaged in devotional service in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, perfect in self-realization, very quickly attains liberation in the Supreme.
		- LIBERATION THROUGH ASTANGA YOGA: A PREVIEW
			- BG 5.27-28
				- Eight steps of astanga-yoga – yama, niyama, asana, pranayama, pratyahara, dharana, dhyana and Samadhi
				- A Kṛṣṇa conscious person, however, being always engaged in devotional service, does not risk losing his senses to some other engagement. This is a better way of controlling the senses than by aṣṭāṅga-yoga.
		- PEACE ON THE PLATFORM OF LIBERATION
			- BG 5.29
				- Lord Kṛṣṇa is the supreme predominator, and all living entities, including the great demigods, are His subordinates. One can attain perfect peace only in complete Kṛṣṇa consciousness.
				- Direct Kṛṣṇa consciousness is __bhakti-yoga,__ and __jñāna-yoga__ is a path leading to __bhakti-yoga__
	- Chapter 6 - Dhyana-yoga
		- ADVANCING IN YOGA THROUGH DETACHED WORK
			- BG 6.1
				- Krishna conscious devotee is the most perfect and true sannyasi and yogi
			- BG 6.4
				- Kṛṣṇa conscious person can do everything for the satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa and thereby be perfectly detached from sense gratification. One who has no such realization must mechanically try to escape material desires before being elevated to the top rung of the __yoga__ ladder.
				- ^^Question: What does Krishna want us to do?^^
				- ^^Answer: the mind which is always engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the cause of supreme liberation^^
		- THE YOGARUDHA STAGE – GIVING UP WORK
			- BG 6.5-6
				- The word __ātmā__ denotes body, mind and soul
				- the pure soul is entangled in the material world because the mind is involved with the false ego. The best way to disentangle oneself is to always engage the mind in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.
				- **For him who has conquered the mind, the mind is the best of friends; but for one who has failed to do so, his mind will remain the greatest enemy.**
				- the mind is conquered, one voluntarily agrees to abide by the dictation of the Personality of Godhead, who is situated within the heart of everyone as Paramātmā
				- ** But when the mind is conquered, one voluntarily agrees to abide by the dictation of the Personality of Godhead, who is situated within the heart of everyone as Paramātmā.**
				- {{[[table]]}}
					- **Controlled Mind**
						- **Uncontrolled Mind**
					- Follows dictation of Supersoul
						- Detached from sense gratification
					- Follows dictation of lust, anger, illusion, etc.
						- Attached to sense gratification
					- Result – Elevates us
						- Result – degrades and entangles
			- BG 6.7
				- **For one who has conquered the mind, the Supersoul is already reached, for he has attained tranquillity. To such a man happiness and distress, heat and cold, honor and dishonor are all the same.**
				- transcendental position is at once achieved by one who is in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the devotee of the **Lord is unaffected by the dualities of material existence, namely distress and happiness, cold and heat, etc. This state is practical __samādhi,__ or absorption in the Supreme.**
			- BG 6.8
				- It is the realized soul who is actually self-controlled, because he is surrendered to Kṛṣṇa. He is transcendental because he has nothing to do with mundane scholarship.** For him mundane scholarship and mental speculation, which may be as good as gold to others, are of no greater value than pebbles or stones.**
		- FURTHER STAGES IN THE PRACTICE OF YOGA
			- BG 6.10
				- But those who are attached to the impersonal Brahman or the localized Supersoul are also partially Kṛṣṇa conscious, because the impersonal Brahman is the spiritual ray of Kṛṣṇa and the Supersoul is the all-pervading partial expansion of Kṛṣṇa.
					- ^^Connect back to krami, jnani, deevote^^
						- impersonalist - localized Supersoul (all-pervading partial expansion)
						- mediator - impersonal Brahman (spiritual ray)
						- devote - Krishna
				- A directly Kṛṣṇa conscious person is the topmost transcendentalist because such a devotee knows what is meant by Brahman and Paramātmā. His knowledge of the Absolute Truth is perfect, whereas the impersonalist and the meditative __yogī__ are imperfectly Kṛṣṇa conscious.
				- The first business of a transcendentalist is to keep the mind always on Kṛṣṇa. One should always think of Kṛṣṇa and not forget Him even for a moment. Concentration of the mind on the Supreme is called __samādhi,__ or trance.
				- ^^Question: How to know what applies to us^^
					- What we should do?
			- BG 6.11-12
				- Therefore, in the __Bṛhan-nāradīya Purāṇa__ it is said that in Kali-yuga (the present __yuga,__ or age), when people in general are short-lived, slow in spiritual realization and always disturbed by various anxieties, the best means of spiritual realization is chanting the holy name of the Lord.
			- BG 6.13-14
				- **One who, however, follows the rules and regulations of married life, having a sexual relationship only with his wife (and that also under regulation), is also called a __brahmacārī.__**
				- Whereas others are forced to restrain themselves from sense gratification, a devotee of the Lord automatically refrains because of superior taste. Other than the devotee, no one has any information of that superior taste.
			- BG 6.15
				- One who seeks an improvement in health or aspires after material perfection is no yogī according to Bhagavad-gītā.
				- Lord is also clearly described in the __Bhagavad-gītā__ as that place where there is no need of sun, moon or electricity. All the planets in the spiritual kingdom are self-illuminated like the sun in the material sky.
				- No one can reach the spiritual sky (Vaikuṇṭha) or enter into the Lord’s eternal abode (Goloka Vṛndāvana) without the proper understanding of Kṛṣṇa and His plenary expansion Viṣṇu.
				- In other words, perfection of the __yoga__ system is the attainment of freedom from material existence and not some magical jugglery or gymnastic feats to befool innocent people.
				- ^^Question: With jana-yoga 134^^
			- BG 6.16
				- **Anyone who eats for sense pleasure, or cooks for himself, not offering his food to Kṛṣṇa, eats only sin. One who eats sin and eats more than is allotted to him cannot execute perfect __yoga.__ It is best that one eat only the remnants of foodstuff offered to Kṛṣṇa. A person in Kṛṣṇa consciousness does not eat anything which is not first offered to Kṛṣṇa. Therefore, only the Kṛṣṇa conscious person can attain perfection in __yoga__ practice. Nor can one who artificially abstains from eating, manufacturing his own personal process of fasting, practice __yoga.__ One who eats more than required will dream very much while sleeping, and he must consequently sleep more than is required. One should not sleep more than six hours daily. One who sleeps more than six hours out of twenty-four is certainly influenced by the mode of ignorance. A person in the mode of ignorance is lazy and prone to sleep a great deal. Such a person cannot perform __yoga.__**
			- BG 6.17
				- __Avyartha-kālatvam:__ a Kṛṣṇa conscious person cannot bear to pass a minute of his life without being engaged in the service of the Lord.
				- **His ideal in this respect is Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī, who was always engaged in the service of Kṛṣṇa and who could not sleep more than two hours a day, and sometimes not even that. Ṭhākura Haridāsa would not even accept __prasādam__ nor even sleep for a moment without finishing his daily routine of chanting with his beads three hundred thousand names.**
			- BG 6.18
			- BG 6.19
				- As a lamp in a windless place does not waver, so the transcendentalist, whose mind is controlled, remains always steady in his meditation on the transcendent Self.
			- BG 6.20-23
				- __kaivalyam__ is an internal, or transcendental, potency by which the living entity becomes aware of his constitutional position
				- The theory of nirvāṇa – also preliminary – corresponds with this principle. In the Bhāgavatam (2.10.6) this is called svarūpeṇa vyavasthitiḥ
				- When one becomes situated in the transcendental position by various philosophical researches, he is said to have achieved __samprajñāta-samādhi__
				- __asamprajñāta-samādhi__ there is no longer any connection with mundane pleasure, for one is then transcendental to all sorts of happiness derived from the senses
				- The best practice of __yoga__ in this age is Kṛṣṇa consciousness, which is not baffling. A Kṛṣṇa conscious person is so happy in his occupation that he does not aspire after any other happiness. **There are many impediments, especially in this age of hypocrisy, to practicing __haṭha-yoga, dhyāna-yoga__ and __jñāna-yoga,__ but there is no such problem in executing __karma-yoga__ or __bhakti-yoga.__**
				- **But a person who is in pure __bhakti-yoga,__ or in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, does not arouse the senses while meeting the demands of the body. Rather, he accepts the bare necessities of life, making the best use of a bad bargain, and enjoys transcendental happiness in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. He is callous toward incidental occurrences – such as accidents, disease, scarcity and even the death of a most dear relative – but he is always alert to execute his duties in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, or __bhakti-yoga.__**
			- BG 6.24
				- A sparrow laid her eggs on the shore of the ocean, but the big ocean carried away the eggs on its waves. The sparrow became very upset and asked the ocean to return her eggs. The ocean did not even consider her appeal. So the sparrow decided to dry up the ocean. She began to pick out the water in her small beak, and everyone laughed at her for her impossible determination. The news of her activity spread, and at last Garuḍa, the gigantic bird carrier of Lord Viṣṇu, heard it. He became compassionate toward his small sister bird, and so he came to see the sparrow. Garuḍa was very pleased by the determination of the small sparrow, and he promised to help. Thus Garuḍa at once asked the ocean to return her eggs lest he himself take up the work of the sparrow. The ocean was frightened at this, and returned the eggs. Thus the sparrow became happy by the grace of Garuḍa.
				- **Similarly, the practice of __yoga,__ especially __bhakti-yoga__ in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, may appear to be a very difficult job. But if anyone follows the principles with great determination, the Lord will surely help, for God helps those who help themselves.**
			- BG 6.25
				- **__pratyāhāra__** -  proper conviction and intelligence one should gradually cease sense activities
				- One should think of no pleasure aside from the pleasure of the Supreme Self.

					- Step by step one achieves success (6.25)
			- BG 6.26
				- One who controls the mind (and therefore the senses as well) is called __gosvāmī,__ or __svāmī,__
				- one who is controlled by the mind is called __go-dāsa__
			- BG 6.27
				- __Brahma-bhūta__ is the state of being free from material contamination and situated in the transcendental service of the Lord.
			- BG 6.29
				- **A true yogī observes Me in all beings and also sees every being in Me. Indeed, the self-realized person sees Me, the same Supreme Lord, everywhere.**
				- As the mother is neutral to all different kinds of children, the Supreme father (or mother) is also neutral. Consequently the Supersoul is always in every living being
			- BG 6.30
				- Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the development of love of Kṛṣṇa – a position transcendental even to material liberation.
			- BG 6.32
				- And because one in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is happy, he tries to distribute the knowledge of Kṛṣṇa everywhere.
				- Since the perfect __yogī__ tries to broadcast the importance of becoming Kṛṣṇa conscious, he is the best philanthropist in the world, and he is the dearest servitor of the Lord
		- NECESSITY OF CONTROLLING THE MIND
			- BG 6.33
				- The method prescribed is __sa vai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayoḥ:__ one must engage one’s mind fully in Kṛṣṇa. Only then will there remain no other engagements to agitate the mind.
			- BG 6.34
				- **Arjuna says that the mind is very strong and is more difficult than controlling the wind**
				- ^^the mind is so strong in fact that it overcomes intelligence^^

					- bala-vat — strong
					- dṛḍham — obstinate
				- Analog of chariot
					- Individual soul – Passenger of the chariot
					- Body – Chariot
					- Intelligence – Driver
					- Mind – Driving instrument
					- Senses – Horses
			- BG 6.35
				- **Lord Krishna said it is very hard to control the mind, but it is possible by practice and detachment**
				- In the current age, it is very hard to control the mind, but it can be done with Krishna consciousness (9-fold system)
					- Ex hearing and eating prasad
					- __Vairāgya __- allows detachment from matter and engagement of the mind in spirit
				- __pareśānubhava__ - attachment to the supreme sprit
			- BG 6.36
				- **Krishna says self-realization is difficult work, but with a controlled mind (by kc) he is assured success**
				- basically just do Krishna consciousness
		- THE DESTINATION OF THE UNSUCCESFUL YOGI
			- BG 6.37
				- **Arjuna asks what happens to a unsuccessful yogi who refrains due to wordily mindedness**
				- ^^"even a little endeavor on the transcendental path offers a great hope for deliverance"^^
				- __yogāc calita-mānasaḥ:__ deviation from the transcendental path
					- lack of seriousness
					- declar war on the illusory endergy
					- modes of material energy
				- Bhakti-yoga is the most suitable path in this age
			- BG 6.38
				- **Arjuna confirms does a person who does not succeced have no position in any sphere **
				- materialists  - no interest in transcendence
				- **Question**: transcendentalist fails, then he apparently loses both ways; in other words, he can enjoy neither material happiness nor spiritual success
			- BG 6.39
				- **Arjuna says Krishna is the only person that can destroy his doubt.**
				- Krishna is perfect because he knows the past, present, and future.
					- No-one is equal or above Krishna
			- BG 6.40
				- **Lord Krishna said a person who does auspicious actives is never overcome by evil**
				- ^^Question: One may argue that by Kṛṣṇa consciousness one may attain the highest perfection if it is completed, but if one does not attain such a perfectional stage, then he loses both materially and spiritually.^^
				- Answer: The Bhāgavatam assures the unsuccessful transcendentalist that there need be no worries.
				- Humanity division
					- Regulated
						- follow the principles of prescribed duties in the scriptures
						- Regulated divisions
							- the followers of scriptural rules and regulations who are enjoying material prosperity

						- Nonregulated division
							- fruitive workers and those who desire no fruit for sense gratification

				- Lord Shiva says: “Vishnu is the deliverer of liberation for everyone”

			- **Krishna says that demons do not surrender unto him**
			- Who pose themselves as such for material gain, do not accept the plan or path of the Supreme Lord.
			- In the __Gītā__ it is clearly mentioned that material energy works fully under the direction of the Supreme Lord.
			- ^^Types of miscreants (duṣkṛtinas) who never surrender unto the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead^^
				- __mūḍhas__- grossly foolish (ass)
				- __narādhama__ - lowest of mankind (no religious principles)

		- BG 7.16
			- **Krishna says there are 4 types of men who pray to the lord: the distressed, the desirer of wealth, the inquisitive, and he who is searching for knowledge of the Absolute. **
			- These persons come to the Supreme Lord for devotional service under different conditions. These are not pure devotees, because they have some aspiration to fulfill in exchange for devotional service. Pure devotional service is without aspiration and without desire for material profit.
			- ^^When these four kinds of persons come to the Supreme Lord for devotional service and are completely purified by the association of a pure devotee, they also become pure devotees.^^
			- **Sukritinas**
			  Pious people
			  Adherent of regulative principles of Scriptures
			  Follow moral and social laws
			  More or less devoted to the Supreme Lord:
				- arta - a person desires relief from sickness (sakama)
					- Ex Gajendra
				- artha-arthi - asks for something material (sakama)
					- Ex Dhruva Maharaja
				- jijnasu - inquisitive and curious for knowlege (sakama)
					- Ex Saunaka Rsi
				- jnani - gain knowledge in Krishna and approach liberation (niskama)
					- Ex Sukadev
			- BG 7.17
				- **Krishna says one who is in full knowledge and who is always engaged in pure devotional service is the best**
				- janani is the best, because he is with pure desires
				- So by association with pure devotees the inquisitive, the distressed, the seeker after material amelioration and the man in knowledge all become themselves pure.
				- He who is situated in pure knowledge of the transcendence of the Supreme Personality of God is so protected in devotional service that material contamination cannot touch him.
			- BG 7.18
				- **Krishna says all these devotees are undoubtedly magnanimous souls, being engaged in My transcendental service, he is sure to attain Me**
				- Every devotee who comes to the Lord is dear to the lord, even in the mood of sakama.
				- However, the dearest devotee is that who is situated in niskama karma yoga, a janani
			- BG 7.19
				- **Krishna says that after many life times, a person in knowledge surrender onto Krishna**
				- Jnana ultimately leads to bhakti
				- “Full knowledge” implies to know Vasudeva as cause of all causes and surrender unto Him
			- BG 7.20
				- **Krishna says who don't have intelligence (due to material desiers) surrender to the demigods**
				- Even when a person has material desires, they should approach the Lord because they will soon become free from all material lust
				- Only the less intelligent people take shelter of demigods
				- ^^Though demigods fulfill a parsons desires more quickly, Krishna purifies the person's heart simultaneously^^
			- BG 7.21
				- **Krishna says he is in everyone's heart, when on desires to worship a demigod, he guides him to them**
				- As the supreme father of all living entities, He does not interfere with their independence, but gives all facilities so that they can fulfill their material desires.
				- ^^Question^^: Some may ask why the all-powerful God gives facilities to the living entities for enjoying this material world and so lets them fall into the trap of the illusory energy.
				- Answer: The answer is that if the Supreme Lord as Supersoul does not give such facilities, then there is no meaning to independence.
			- BG 7.22
				- **Krishna says the benefits are bestowed by Me alone**
				- One who worships the Supreme Lord and at the same time desires material enjoyment is contradictory in his desires
				- Therefore the Supreme Lord does not award material benefits to the pure devotees
			- BG 7.23
				- **Krishna says people who worship the demigods go to the planet of the demigods, and those who worship Me reach My supreme planet**
				- The material world but the devotee of the Supreme Lord goes directly to the supreme planet of the Personality of Godhead.
			- BG 7.24
				- **Krishna has always been imperishable and supereme**
				- One must understand Him by devotional service.
				- the worshipers of the demigods go to the different planets of the demigods, and those who are devotees of Lord Kṛṣṇa go to the Kṛṣṇaloka planet.
			- BG 7.25
				- **Krishna says he never manifests to the foolish and unintelligent**
				- Supreme Lord (Absolute Truth) hides from foolish and unintelligent by covering himself via His internal potency
		- Bewilderment and Freedom by knowing Krishna
			- BG 7.26
				- **Krishna says He know the past, present, and future, but no one knows me.**
				- Even if one is perfected by realization of impersonal Brahman or localized Paramātmā, he cannot possibly understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, without being in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.
				- alpha-medhasah: less intelligent
			- BG 7.27
				- **Krishna says all living entities are born into delusion**
				- The real constitutional position of the living entity is that of subordination to the Supreme Lord, who is pure knowledge.
				- It is our fortune that we can understand that Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa appears by His internal potencies
			- BG 7.28
				- **Krishna says those who act piously in many births are freed from the dualities of delusion, and they engage themselves in My service with determination**
				- We have to understand our constitutional position to be fully engaged in His transcendental loving service with determination.
				- But the grace and glance of a pure devotee, one can get purified
			- BG 7.29
				- **Krishna says intelligent persons who are endeavoring for liberation from old age and death take refuge in Me in devotional service**
				- In devotional service, they are acting as Brahman because know everything about transcendental activities
			- BG 7.30
				- **Krishna says thoses in full conciousness can know me**
				- **Devotees understand Krishna as Adhibhuta, Adhidaiva and Adhiyajna**
				- Persons acting in Kṛṣṇa consciousness are never deviated from the path of entirely understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the transcendental association of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, one can understand how the Supreme Lord is the governing principle of the material manifestation and even of the demigods. Gradually, by such transcendental association, one becomes convinced of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and at the time of death such a Kṛṣṇa conscious person can never forget Kṛṣṇa. Naturally he is thus promoted to the planet of the Supreme Lord, Goloka Vṛndāvana.
				- Discussed in chapter
					- he man in distress
					- the inquisitive man
					- the man in want of material necessities
					- knowledge of Brahman, knowledge of Paramātmā
					- liberation from birth, death and diseases, and worship of the Supreme Lord.
				- ^^However, he who is actually elevated in Kṛṣṇa consciousness does not care for the different processes. He simply directly engages himself in activities of Kṛṣṇa consciousness and thereby factually attains his constitutional position as an eternal servitor of Lord Kṛṣṇa.^^
				- Drdha-vrta: determined faith. This is the beginning of Bhakti-yoga
