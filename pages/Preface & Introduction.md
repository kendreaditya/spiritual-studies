		- The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is conducted under the supervision of Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī.
		- Śrīla Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura has sung:
		  
		  rūpa-raghunātha-pade ha-ibe ākuti
		  kabe hāma bujhaba se yugala-pīriti
		  
		  “When I am eager to understand the literature given by the Gosvāmīs, then I shall be able to understand the transcendental loving affairs of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa.”
		- The most exalted of all the activities of Lord Kṛṣṇa are His pastimes of conjugal love with the gopīs.
		- In all spiritual affairs, one’s first duty is to control his mind and senses. Unless one controls his mind and senses, one cannot make any advancement in spiritual life.
		- Everyone within this material world is engrossed in the modes of passion and ignorance. One must promote himself to the platform of goodness, sattva-guṇa, by following the instructions of Rūpa Gosvāmī
		- A follower of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement should become a perfect gosvāmī
		- Go means “the senses,” and svāmī means “the master.” Unless one controls his senses and mind, one cannot become a gosvāmī.
