	- ***Saktyavesa-Avatara***
	  
	  And after the disappearance of Srila Prabhupada, Srila Sridhara Maharaja declared,
	  
	  I consider him to be *saktyavesa avatara,*![](https://gosai.com/chaitanya/saranagati/html/vishnu_mjs/affection_unabridged/dot_clear.gif) and it is confirmed in his writings on his spiritual journey through the Atlantic. How he landed there in America, and the nature of his beginning the movement, his intense degree of dedication to Krsna and dependence, and how much he made himself empty of any other desire that the order of his *gurudeva*--quite empty that Krsna came down to help him, and it is corroborated that Krsna worked on his behalf.
	  In his poem, "*Prayer to the Lotus Feet of Krsna*," we find him pleading with Krsna, 'My dear Brother, Your good fortune will come to You only when Srimati Radharani becomes pleased with You.' Seeing his *gurudeva*! Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati as Radharani's delegation and his order as Her divine service, he humbly submitted that he did not feel himself worthy or fit to discharge the divine service, so he enlisted Krsna in the service of his guru. He had completely dedicated himself to the purpose, he was so earnest in his prayer to Krsna that he may discharge the duty that he has been given by his *guru maharaja,*![](https://gosai.com/chaitanya/saranagati/html/vishnu_mjs/affection_unabridged/dot_clear.gif) that divine force, power, came down to help him. Otherwise, it is impossible. It is not a thing of the ordinary level that anyone will do, but the highest thing has been taken down to the lowest position so extensively. It cannot but be the divine power, embodied and in a great intensity and magnitude! So, *saktyavesa-avatara,*![] I cannot but take him to be so."
